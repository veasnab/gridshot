## Summary

This project is my first attempt after learning React. The goal was to demonstrate my understanding of components and hooks such as `useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect`. To showcase these skills, I decided to create a clone of the "Gridshot" game from **Aim Lab**.

You can play the game and see my work live on GitHub Pages: [https://veasnab.github.io/gridshot/](https://veasnab.github.io/gridshot/)

## Outcome

The project was built using **Vite** and **React**, utilizing JSX syntax. Hereâ€™s a list of tools and technologies used:
